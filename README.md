the custom cat and dog images are trained using convolutional neural networks and pooling layers, model which then is used to predict differnt new images of either cat or dog
libraries used:
#keras
methodology:
#load the image directory
#resize the images
#create model
#train model
#evaluate the model
#predict on new images
